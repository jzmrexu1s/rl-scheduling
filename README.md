# RL-Scheduling

A scheduling simulator supporting RL-based scheduler and power aware features, based on SimSo.  

SimSo is a scheduling simulator for real-time multiprocessor architectures that takes into account some scheduling overheads (scheduling decisions, context switches) and the impact of caches through statistical models. Based on a Discrete-Event Simulator (SimPy), it allows quick simulations and a fast prototyping of scheduling policies using Python. Currently, [more than 25 popular schedulers are available](https://maximecheramy.github.io/simso/).
